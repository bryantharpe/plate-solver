# math-core Specification

## Purpose

The shared numerical foundation every other capability computes on: conversion between
`(RA, Dec)` and unit vectors, angular distance via `2·arcsin(d/2)`, pinhole projection and its
inverse, radial lens distortion both ways, attitude determination from matched vectors
(Wahba/SVD) and its decomposition to RA/Dec/Roll, the rotation- and scale-invariant edge-ratio
pattern key with its hash and table index, FOV estimation and refinement, the binomial
false-alarm test, and residual statistics.

Nothing here is astronomy-specific policy — it is the math the detector, the database, the
generator, and the solver all share, and it is where numerical parity with the Python reference
is won or lost. Its tolerances are the tightest in the spec set precisely because every other
capability inherits its error.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Celestial unit-vector conversion

The system SHALL convert between celestial coordinates `(RA, Dec)` in radians and equatorial
unit vectors using `x = cos(RA)cos(Dec)`, `y = sin(RA)cos(Dec)`, `z = sin(Dec)`, and the
inverse `RA = atan2(y, x) mod 2π`, `Dec = arcsin(z)`. (Ref: doc 02 §1.3.)

#### Scenario: Forward conversion produces a unit vector
- **WHEN** `(RA, Dec)` are converted to `(x, y, z)`
- **THEN** the result has unit norm within 1e-12
- **AND** `x = cos(RA)cos(Dec)`, `y = sin(RA)cos(Dec)`, `z = sin(Dec)`

#### Scenario: Round-trip is identity
- **WHEN** `(RA, Dec)` with `Dec` in `(-π/2, π/2)` are converted to a vector and back
- **THEN** the recovered `(RA mod 2π, Dec)` equals the input within 1e-12

### Requirement: Angular distance via 2·arcsin(d/2)

The system SHALL compute the central angle between two unit vectors at chord (Euclidean)
distance `d` as `angle = 2·arcsin(d/2)`, and the inverse `d = 2·sin(angle/2)`. This form MUST
be used everywhere (pattern edges, residuals, FOV math) in preference to `arccos(u·v)` for
small-angle conditioning. (Ref: doc 02 §2.)

#### Scenario: Angle/chord inversion
- **WHEN** an angle is converted to a chord distance and back
- **THEN** the recovered angle equals the input within 1e-12

#### Scenario: Small-angle conditioning
- **WHEN** two unit vectors are separated by a sub-arcsecond angle
- **THEN** `2·arcsin(d/2)` returns the angle without the precision loss that `arccos(u·v)`
  exhibits near 1

### Requirement: Pinhole projection — pixels to camera vectors

The system SHALL map pixel centroids `(y, x)` to camera-frame unit vectors `(i, j, k)` for a
rectilinear lens of horizontal field of view `fov` and image `width`, using
`scale_factor = 2·tan(fov/2)/width`, assigning `(k, j) = (img_center − centroid)·scale_factor`
with `img_center = [height/2, width/2]`, `i = 1` (boresight), then normalizing each vector to
unit length. (Ref: doc 02 §3.1.)

#### Scenario: Image center maps to the boresight
- **WHEN** the centroid equals the image center `[height/2, width/2]`
- **THEN** the resulting unit vector is the boresight `(1, 0, 0)`

#### Scenario: Horizontal edge maps to tan(fov/2)
- **WHEN** a centroid lies at the horizontal image edge (`width/2` from center in x)
- **THEN** before normalization its `j` component equals `tan(fov/2)`

### Requirement: Pinhole projection — camera vectors to pixels

The system SHALL map derotated camera-frame vectors back to pixel coordinates using
`scale_factor = −width/(2·tan(fov/2))`, `centroids = scale_factor · vec[:, (k, j)] / vec[:, i]`,
offset by `[height/2, width/2]`, and SHALL return the indices of vectors that fall inside the
image (`0 < y < height`, `0 < x < width`). Vectors with non-positive boresight component
(`i ≤ 0`, behind the camera) MUST be excluded. (Ref: doc 02 §3.2.)

#### Scenario: Projection inverts unprojection
- **WHEN** an in-frame centroid is converted to a vector and projected back at the same `fov`
- **THEN** the recovered `(y, x)` equals the original within 1e-9

#### Scenario: Behind-camera vectors are dropped
- **WHEN** a vector has boresight component `i ≤ 0`
- **THEN** it is not returned in the in-frame `keep` set

### Requirement: Lens distortion — undistort centroids

The system SHALL undistort centroids in closed form for a single-parameter radial model where
`k` is the fractional displacement at the half-width radius: center the coords, compute radius
`r`, scale by `(1 − k'·r²)/(1 − k)` with `k' = k·(2/width)²`, then decenter. `k < 0` is barrel,
`k > 0` pincushion. (Ref: doc 02 §4.1.)

#### Scenario: Zero distortion is identity
- **WHEN** centroids are undistorted with `k = 0`
- **THEN** the output equals the input exactly

#### Scenario: Center pixel is fixed
- **WHEN** a centroid at the image center is undistorted with any `k`
- **THEN** its position is unchanged

### Requirement: Lens distortion — distort centroids

The system SHALL apply the forward distortion `r_u → r_d` by Newton–Raphson inversion of the
undistortion model (default `tol = 1e-6`, `maxiter = 30`), so that distorting then undistorting
with the same `k` round-trips. (Ref: doc 02 §4.2.)

#### Scenario: Distort/undistort round-trip
- **WHEN** centroids are distorted and then undistorted with the same `k`
- **THEN** the recovered positions equal the originals within `tol`

#### Scenario: Convergence bound
- **WHEN** the Newton iteration is run
- **THEN** it terminates within `maxiter` iterations or when `max|error| < tol`

### Requirement: Attitude determination via Wahba/SVD

The system SHALL solve Wahba's problem for the least-squares rotation relating ordered,
corresponding image-frame and catalog-frame unit-vector sets via the cross-covariance
`H = image_vectorsᵀ · catalog_vectors`, `U, S, Vᵀ = svd(H)`, `R = U·Vᵀ`. (Ref: doc 02 §5.)

#### Scenario: Recovers a known rotation
- **WHEN** catalog vectors are rotated by a known `R0` to produce image vectors and the solver
  is run on the pair
- **THEN** the returned `R` equals `R0` within 1e-9

#### Scenario: Uses 2·arcsin residual convention
- **WHEN** residuals are computed after attitude
- **THEN** per-star angle uses `2·arcsin(d/2)` of the chord between matched vectors

### Requirement: Reflection guard via det(R)

The system SHALL treat a candidate attitude whose rotation matrix has `det(R) < 0` (a
reflection, not a proper rotation) as a false positive to be rejected, matching cedar's fast
filter. (Ref: doc 02 §5, doc 06 §5.)

#### Scenario: Reflection is rejected
- **WHEN** an attitude candidate yields `det(R) < 0`
- **THEN** the candidate is rejected as a reflection

### Requirement: RA/Dec/Roll extraction from attitude

The system SHALL extract pointing from `R` (rows are camera axes in the celestial frame) as
`RA = atan2(R[0,1], R[0,0]) mod 2π`, `Dec = atan2(R[0,2], ‖R[1:3,2]‖)`,
`Roll = atan2(R[1,2], R[2,2]) mod 2π`, where row 0 is the boresight (image-center) direction.
(Ref: doc 02 §5.1.)

#### Scenario: Boresight row gives image-center RA/Dec
- **WHEN** RA/Dec are extracted from `R`
- **THEN** they equal the spherical coordinates of `R[0, :]`

### Requirement: Edge-ratio pattern key

The system SHALL compute a 4-star pattern's key by: forming all `C(4,2)=6` pairwise edge angles
(`2·arcsin(½‖vi−vj‖)`), sorting ascending, taking the largest edge `L` as normalizer, computing
the 5 ratios `e[m]/L` for `m = 0..4`, and quantizing each as `key[m] = int(ratio·pattern_bins)`,
with `pattern_bins = round(1/(4·pattern_max_error))`. The 5-tuple is the pattern key, the
rotation- and scale-invariant fingerprint. (Ref: doc 02 §6.1.)

#### Scenario: Key is rotation- and scale-invariant
- **WHEN** the same 4 stars are presented at a different orientation and angular scale
- **THEN** the resulting edge-ratio pattern key is identical

#### Scenario: Bins follow the max-error formula
- **WHEN** `pattern_max_error = 0.001`
- **THEN** `pattern_bins = 250` (and `0.005 → 50`)

### Requirement: Pattern key hash and table index

The system SHALL pack a pattern key into a 64-bit positional code
`key_hash = Σ_m key[m]·pattern_bins^m`, and map it to a table index as
`(key_hash · _MAGIC_RAND) mod table_size` for quadratic-probe tables (`_MAGIC_RAND =
2654435761`), or `key_hash mod table_size` for linear-probe (prime-sized) tables. 64-bit
overflow wraps intentionally. (Ref: doc 02 §6.2.)

#### Scenario: Distinct keys get distinct 64-bit codes
- **WHEN** two different 5-tuples within `[0, pattern_bins)` are packed
- **THEN** their `key_hash` values differ

#### Scenario: Magic constant value
- **WHEN** the quadratic-probe index is computed
- **THEN** `_MAGIC_RAND` equals `2654435761` (`⌊2³²/φ⌋`)

### Requirement: Open-addressing probe sequence

The system SHALL resolve hash-table collisions by probing slots `i = (hash_index + offset(c))
mod table_size` for `c = 0, 1, 2, …`, where `offset(c) = c·c` (quadratic) or `c` (linear),
inserting at the first all-zero slot, and on lookup returning every occupied slot up to the
first empty one. (Ref: doc 02 §6.3.)

#### Scenario: Lookup returns the full probe chain
- **WHEN** several patterns collide into the same starting slot
- **THEN** lookup returns all occupied slots in probe order until the first empty slot

#### Scenario: Insertion mirrors lookup ordering
- **WHEN** a pattern is inserted under probing
- **THEN** a subsequent lookup of the same key visits that slot before the first empty slot

### Requirement: 16-bit key pre-filter

The system SHALL store, per pattern, the low 16 bits of its `key_hash` (`key_hash & 0xFFFF`) so
that lookup can cheaply discard probe-chain slots whose stored 16-bit hash differs from the
query's, before any vector math. (Ref: doc 02 §6.4.)

#### Scenario: Mismatched 16-bit hash is discarded
- **WHEN** a probed slot's stored 16-bit hash differs from the query `key_hash & 0xFFFF`
- **THEN** that slot is discarded before edge-ratio comparison

### Requirement: Centroid-distance pattern ordering

The system SHALL order the 4 stars of a pattern by ascending distance from the pattern centroid
(mean of the 4 unit vectors), so that the m-th image star corresponds to the m-th catalog star
for attitude solving. (Ref: doc 02 §7.)

#### Scenario: Deterministic correspondence
- **WHEN** an image pattern and its matching catalog pattern are each ordered by centroid
  distance
- **THEN** star `m` of one corresponds to star `m` of the other

### Requirement: FOV estimation from a matched pattern

The system SHALL estimate FOV from a matched pattern either by scaling a supplied estimate
(`fov = catalog_largest_edge / image_largest_edge · fov_initial`) or, absent an estimate, by
solving focal length from the largest pixel distance and the catalog largest angle
(`f = largest_pixel_dist / 2 / tan(catalog_largest_edge/2)`, `fov = 2·arctan((width/2)/f)`). The
diagonal FOV used to gather nearby stars is `fov·√(w²+h²)/w`. (Ref: doc 02 §8.)

#### Scenario: Scale a supplied estimate
- **WHEN** a `fov_estimate` is provided and a catalog pattern matches
- **THEN** the refined `fov` equals `catalog_largest_edge/image_largest_edge · fov_estimate`

#### Scenario: Diagonal FOV relation
- **WHEN** a diagonal FOV is needed
- **THEN** it equals `fov·√(width²+height²)/width`

### Requirement: Fine FOV and distortion refinement

The system SHALL refine FOV after a match: with no distortion, `fov *= mean(angle_catalog /
angle_camera)` over matched pairs; with distortion, least-squares solve for focal length `f` and
`k` from rows `A = [t, r³]`, `b = [r]` (per matched star), then `f /= (1−k)`,
`fov = 2·arctan(1/f)`. (Ref: doc 02 §8.1.)

#### Scenario: No-distortion FOV refinement
- **WHEN** distortion is not estimated
- **THEN** `fov` is scaled by the mean ratio of catalog-to-camera matched angles

### Requirement: Binomial false-alarm test

The system SHALL accept or reject a candidate attitude by a binomial false-alarm probability,
not a fixed match count: with `n` extracted centroids, `Nc` projected nearby catalog stars, `m`
matches, and `match_radius` (fraction of width), compute `prob_single = Nc·match_radius²` and
`prob_mismatch = binom.cdf(n − (m − 2), n, 1 − prob_single)`, accepting when
`prob_mismatch < match_threshold`. `match_threshold` MUST be divided by `num_patterns`
(Bonferroni); reported `Prob` MUST be `prob_mismatch · num_patterns`. The `−2` accounts for the
two degrees of freedom consumed fitting the attitude. (Ref: doc 02 §9.)

#### Scenario: More matches lower the false-alarm probability
- **WHEN** the match count `m` increases with `n`, `Nc`, `match_radius` fixed
- **THEN** `prob_mismatch` decreases

#### Scenario: Bonferroni correction over patterns tried
- **WHEN** the test runs against a database of `num_patterns` patterns
- **THEN** the effective threshold is `match_threshold / num_patterns` and the reported
  probability is `prob_mismatch · num_patterns`

### Requirement: Residual statistics

The system SHALL compute solution residuals by projecting matched image vectors to the sky and
comparing to matched catalog vectors: per-star `angle = 2·arcsin(‖diff‖/2)`,
`RMSE = rad2deg(sqrt(mean(angle²)))·3600` arcseconds, plus `P90E` (90th percentile) and `MAXE`
(maximum) in arcseconds. (Ref: doc 02 §10.)

#### Scenario: RMSE reported in arcseconds
- **WHEN** residuals are computed over matched stars
- **THEN** `RMSE`, `P90E`, and `MAXE` are returned in arcseconds, with `P90E ≤ MAXE`

### Requirement: Numerical conventions and reference parity

The system SHALL compute in f64 and MAY store database vectors as f32 (reference dtype), and
SHALL hold to the binding conventions: `(y,x)` pixels with `(0.5,0.5)` = top-left pixel center,
the `2·arcsin(d/2)` angle form, and `pattern_bins = round(1/(4·pattern_max_error))`. Outputs
SHALL match the Python reference (tetra3/cedar) within stated tolerances, enforced as the
correctness contract for this and dependent capabilities. (Ref: doc 02; project.md §5.)

#### Scenario: Parity with reference primitives
- **WHEN** angle, projection, distortion round-trip, attitude, pattern key, and false-alarm
  outputs are computed for captured reference inputs
- **THEN** each matches the cedar reference value within tolerance (angles/projections < 1e-9;
  identical integer pattern keys; false-alarm probability within 1e-6 relative)
