## Platform

web

## Stack

React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS for the page, served by the Rust `finder` binary
(axum), with the production bundle committed and embedded in the binary so `cargo build` and
CI never need Node. The user ruled out plain HTML/CSS/JS ("bland, and scalability suffers")
and delegated the framework: React was chosen for the ecosystem the later pieces need (live
camera view, mount controls, an AI chat panel, offline use) and because v1's `ps-web` already
proved this shape in this repo.

## Users

One amateur astronomer, the project's maintainer, with a Sky-Watcher 400P (16-inch) GoTo
Dobsonian and a finder camera. They use the console about equally at the telescope at night
and indoors testing frames, on an Android phone or a Surface laptop.

## Product Purpose

The finder console turns one camera frame into where the telescope is pointing, what is in
and near the field, and what to look at next. Today it solves still frames (the bundled
samples or an upload). It is the program that will later run the live camera, the SkySafari
link, GoTo control and AI steering. Success now: at a glance, and with proof, the user can
see that the solver works and where a frame points.

## Positioning

The solver behind it gives cedar's answers on cedar's reference frames and runs fast enough
for a live camera stream (README benchmark), and the console is built to grow into
closed-loop GoTo and AI-steered observing rather than stopping at push-to.

## Operating Context

- At the telescope: red light only, phone in one hand, glancing between eyepiece and screen.
  The telescope stands within reach of the house Wi-Fi (internet over Starlink), so the
  internet is usually there but never needed.
- Indoors: desk in normal light, Surface (Windows on ARM, WSL2) or phone browser.
- Three devices on the house Wi-Fi (ADR-0001):
  - the console runs in WSL2 on the Surface: it solves, keeps the pointing model, plans moves
    and serves the page;
  - a scope node (a Raspberry Pi 3B riding on the telescope) runs the finder camera (an
    Arducam on its CSI ribbon, model still unknown) and a USB cable straight to the mount's
    motor controller; it finds the stars in each frame and carries out axis commands;
  - the phone and the laptop open the page, and share one observing session.
- The site is typed once (the Surface has no GPS); time comes from the console's clock.
- Out of scope for now: SkySafari's link, the AI assistant and the mobile app. They will use
  the same pointing state when they come.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Solve a frame: star detection and a lost-in-space solve with no pointing prior; RA/Dec,
  roll, field of view, matched catalog stars, residuals, timing.
- After a solve, "where it points" comes first: large RA/Dec, the constellation, and what is
  in the field. The annotated frame comes second (user's answer).
- The annotated frame shows detected stars, matched catalog stars with names, and Messier
  objects in the field: the proof.
- Next targets: objects near the field, and objects similar to one in it that are up now.
  Rules today; AI later.
- Works offline; online extras (Aladin survey imagery) are optional.
- The default database covers 10–30° fields; frames from other cameras need a matching one.
  The finder camera's field is probably outside it, so it gets its own database at bring-up.
- Next, in four steps (specified, not yet built; `openspec/project.md` §3):
  1. Targets and push-to, with no hardware: search OpenNGC (Messier, NGC, IC, common names)
     for a target, learn whether it is pointable (above the minimum altitude, default 15°,
     and outside the Sun guard, which is always on), and get "turn clockwise 34° · tilt up
     12°" from where the last frame points. A Setup page holds the site and minimum altitude.
  2. Live finder: the scope node streams star lists from the finder camera, the console
     solves them live, and the aim point (the eyepiece's spot in the finder camera's frame)
     is set by tapping a centred star.
  3. GoTo: no star alignment; every solve is a sync, a pointing model is fitted from them,
     and the console drives the 16-inch Dob's two axes in a closed loop to within 1′.
  4. Tracking: pointing-model rates corrected by solves every 1–5 s, with the field rotation
     and longest exposure reported for an imaging camera.
- A simulated scope node (`finder --simulate`) stands in for the telescope at the desk and in
  CI.
- Still out: typed RA/Dec, named stars, the Moon and planets as targets; a horizon that varies
  by direction; field derotation; SkySafari, AI, the mobile app.

## Brand Commitments

None yet. The repository is `plate-solver`; the app is the finder console.

## Evidence on Hand

- 21 cedar sample frames in `reference-solutions/cedar-solve/examples/data/medium_fov/`;
  20 solve at the default threshold, as they do in cedar; `roof.jpg` solves only at 5σ.
- Benchmark numbers in `README.md`, from one Snapdragon laptop under WSL2.
- No frames from the user's own finder camera yet: never imply real-hardware results.

## Product Principles

1. Prove, don't claim: every answer shows its evidence, the matched stars on the frame.
2. Night is a first-class mode: nothing on screen may break dark adaptation.
3. Glanceable first, detail on demand.
4. Every view is a client of the same pointing state that SkySafari, the mount and the AI
   will use.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- Night mode is red-only and dim, with no white flashes, images and embedded views included.
- Large touch targets for one-handed use in the cold (inferred).
- Day mode meets WCAG AA contrast; night mode trades contrast for dark adaptation (inferred).
